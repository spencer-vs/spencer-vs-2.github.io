                    Manchester United have won a record 13 titles in the Premier League since the top flight of English football was given that new name in 1992.Sir Alex Ferguson was the man who masterminded the triumph in the inaugural Premier League season, in 1992/93. The Reds went on to win titles in 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013, more than all other clubs put together to date. It took a while for Ferguson to really get going, though the club stuck by him. Essentially adopting Busby’s approach of focusing on youth, this began to slowly pay dividends. The beginning of the Premier League era (1992/93 season), the club’s fortunes started to change, including winning the first PL title, finishing 10 points ahead of Aston Villa.
